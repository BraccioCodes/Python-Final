# Remote Work and Mental Health Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive analysis of a dataset focused on the impact of remote work on mental health. Using this dataset, I will explore key questions surrounding the challenges and effects of remote work on employees' mental well-being. The motivating question for this analysis is: **"How can I use Python to gain insights into the relationship between remote work and mental health?"**

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iramshahzadi9/remote-work-and-mental-health). It contains responses from employees across various industries, focusing on their experiences and mental health while working remotely. The data includes features such as:

- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Job role**
- **Work-life balance**
- **Stress levels**
- **Frequency of remote work**
- **Mental health support availability**

These variables will be analyzed to understand trends and relationships between remote work conditions and mental health outcomes.

## Key Questions to Explore

- What are the key factors that affect mental health while working remotely?
- How does work-life balance correlate with reported stress levels?
- Is there a noticeable difference in mental health challenges based on age, gender, or job role?
- How do employees' perceptions of mental health support availability impact their well-being?

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization
