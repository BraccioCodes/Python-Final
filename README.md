# Work and Mental Health Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive analysis of a dataset focused on the impact of work on mental health. Using this dataset, I will explore key questions surrounding the challenges and effects of work on employees' mental well-being. The motivating question for this analysis is: **"How can I use Python to gain insights into the relationship between work and mental health?"**

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iramshahzadi9/remote-work-and-mental-health). It contains responses from employees across various industries, focusing on their experiences and mental health while working remotely. The data includes columns such as:

- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Job role**
- **Work-life balance**
- **Stress levels**
- **Region**

These variables will be analyzed to understand trends and relationships between work conditions and mental health outcomes.

## Key Questions to Explore

- What are the key factors that affect mental health while working?
- How do weekly worked hours correlate with reported stress levels?
- Does stress level vary by industry?
  
## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization

## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
